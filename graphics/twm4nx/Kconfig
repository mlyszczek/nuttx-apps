	default n
	select NX_RAMBACKED
	select NXWIDGETS
	depends on NX && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Enable Tom's Window Manager (TWM) for NuttX (Twm4Nx).

		Use of this window manager requires keyboard and mouse input.
		Output is through the NX server.

if GRAPHICS_TWM4NX

config TWM4NX_PROGNAME
	string "Twm4Nx program name"
	default "twm4nx"
	depends on BUILD_LOADABLE
	---help---
		This is the name of the program that will be use when the NSH ELF
		program is installed.

config TWM4NX_PRIORITY
	int "Twm4Nx task priority"
	default 100

config TWM4NX_STACKSIZE
	int "Twm4Nx stack size"
	default 2048

config TWM4NX_REVMAJOR
	string "Twm4Nx major version number"
	default "0"

config TWM4NX_REVMINOR
	string "Twm4Nx minor version number"
	default "0"

config TWM4NX_ARCHINIT
	bool "Have architecture-specific initialization"
	default n
	select LIB_BOARDCTL
	depends on !NSH_ARCHINIT
	---help---
		Set if your board provides architecture specific initialization
		via the board-interface function boardctl().  The boardctl()
		function will be called early in Twm4Nx initialization to allow
		board logic to do such things as configure MMC/SD slots.

config TWM4NX_NETINIT
	bool "Network initialization"
	default y
	depends on NET
	select NETUTILS_NETINIT
	depends on !NSH_ARCHINIT
	---help---
		This option enables/disables all network initialization in Twm4Nx.

config TWM4NX_VNCSERVER
	bool "Use VNC Server"
	default y
	depends on VNCSERVER
	select TWM4NX_NOKEYBOARD
	select TWM4NX_NOMOUSE
	---help---
		If selected, then keyboard and positional input will come from the
		VNC server.  In this case all other input settings are ignored.

config TWM4NX_NOKEYBOARD
	bool "Disable keyboard"
	default n
	---help---
		Normally you would never disable keyboard input.  That would make
		using many Twm4Nx applications impossible.  However, this setting
		is sometimes useful for debugging Twm4Nx bringup in a simpler
		environment (it is also used if VNC is selected)

config TWM4NX_NOMOUSE
	bool "Disable mouse/touchscreen"
	default n
	---help---
		Normally you would never disable mouse input.  That would make using
		Twm4Nx impossible.  However, this setting is sometimes useful for
		debugging Twm4Nx bringup in a simpler environment (it is also used
		if VNC is selected)

config TWM4NX_DEBUG
	bool "Force debug output"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FEATURES
	---help---
		This option will force graphics debug output for Twm4Nx even if
		graphics debug output is not enabled.  This is useful for very low
		level debug of the Twm4Nx logic without interfering output from
		other graphics components.

		NOTE: The level of this Twm4Nx debug is still controlled by the
		basic debug output settings CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO, CONFIG_DEBUG_WARN,
		and CONFIG_DEBUG_ERROR (but not the corresponding
		CONFIG_DEBUG_GRAPHICS_* settings)
